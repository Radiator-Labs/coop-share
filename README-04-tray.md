# Condensate Tray

Add water sensor to condensate tray to alarm building management
if water level is too high:

## Sensor

Liquid sensor is simple on/off type, but exact sensor is TBD. An
issue to consider in selecting the sensor is the long cable run
from the new box to the existing condensate tray. The long cable
run must not cause interference in the sensor signal.

Here are examples of two types of on/off liquid sensors:

- https://www.adafruit.com/product/4965

Either type is acceptable as long as the long cable does not
cause interference in the on/off signal.

## Cable length

Use an 8-foot cable to connect water sensor to electronics.

*The condensate tray is on the opposite end from the junction
box.*
