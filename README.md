# About

Radiator Labs (RL) specifications for freelancer to design and
build a box for installation by an electrician in hardware
upgrade pilot of ten existing residential HVAC units in NYC.

## Deliverables

Final deliverables include:

- 10 box builds
- bill of materials
- installation instructions for an electrician to mount the box
  and connect to existing branch circuit wiring
- video demonstration of all functionality
- video demonstration of all tests
- instructions for Radiator Labs to repeat all tests

## Scope of work

Scope of work includes:

- identify off-the-shelf electronic components (such as
  development boards) and submit to RL for approval
- identify all electrical materials and wiring methods (such as
  conductor type and size, termination methods, method for
  running existing branch circuit wiring into new box, etc.)
- identify requirements, if any, for over-current protection and
  disconnect switch inside the new box
- build and test one box and demo to RL for approval prior to
  building all ten boxes
    - perform all tests of functionality on first box build
    - perform smaller set of tests on subsequent builds
- identify, and demonstrate design is in compliance with,
  any applicable articles from [NFPA 70
  (NEC)](https://link.nfpa.org/free-access/publications/70/2023)
  and from NYC Electrical code: [Local Law 39 of
  2011](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/ll39of2011_electrical_code.pdf)
    - The design must be safe to install/maintain and must not
      pose a fire hazard.
    - *Sign off by a professional engineer (PE) is outside the
      scope of work.*
